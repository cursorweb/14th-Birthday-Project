<div>The <strong>dashboard</strong> button will allow you to create and view birthday cards!</div>
<div>Once you make a birthday card, you will get a slice of the big birthday cookie.</div>
<div>Demand is high, so each person only gets half of the remaining slices.</div>

    <li>The first person gets 1/2 of the cookie.</li>
    <li>The second person gets 1/4 of the cookie.</li>
    <li>The nth person gets 1/2<sup>n</sup> of the cookie, so be fast!</li>
</ol>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Users who didn't sign up with a replit account will lose their cookie slice forever if they forget their username!</div>
